That covers a document that is not an object, has no frame rate, whose <C>tracks</C> is not a list, whose <C>clips</C> is not indexed by track id, that has two tracks with the same id, a track of unknown kind, or a clip with an unknown type, no position or no length.

            A clip carries both a <C>src</C> (what the renderer plays) and an <C>assetId</C> (what the timeline reads its filmstrip and intrinsic size from). Only <C>src</C> survives a save.

            Opening or reloading a document uses the defaults. The playhead belonged to a composition that is gone, so it should stop and return to frame 0, and the document that just arrived is the history&apos;s starting point, so ctrl+Z must not walk back into the empty timeline that existed before it. <C>PlaybackEngine</C> is a separate object that the engine deliberately does not know about, which is why <C>project:loaded</C> carries the <C>transport</C> instruction. <C>EditorProvider</C> subscribes to it and does the rewind for you. If you build your own composition layer, do the same.

              The relink pass does not bring a new composition. It hands back the one already on screen with internal library references repaired, and it lands whenever the project&apos;s assets finish importing, which can be long after the open. By then the user may have trimmed a clip, added a title, or be mid-drag. Resetting history would throw away real undo steps to swap an internal reference, and an open drag still has a <C>commitInteraction()</C> coming. So pass <C>{"{ transport: 'keep', history: 'keep' }"}</C>: the playhead does not jump, and the undo stacks, the interaction snapshot and any open batch survive. Entries already on the stacks still hold the pre-repair references. Undoing past the repair costs a filmstrip, not work, and those ids are session-scoped anyway.

            The media library is module-scoped and starts empty on every load. A clip plays from its own <C>src</C> and never asks the library for anything, so what does not survive is everything only the library held: the filmstrip, the waveform, the real duration and dimensions. A restored composition comes back with grey boxes where the thumbnails were. Two functions carry the library across, and storing the result is up to you.
