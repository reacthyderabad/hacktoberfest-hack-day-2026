          <P>
            Before 0.6.0 the engine capped a project at one video track and <C>addTrack(&apos;video&apos;)</C> returned the existing one. It now adds another lane. Overlapping clips on separate video lanes layer instead of conflicting.
          </P>
          <P>
            Video tracks composite in track order: the resolver derives each clip&apos;s z-index from <C>track.order</C>, and a lower <C>order</C> is closer to the top of the timeline, so the topmost lane draws on top. A new video track is placed directly below the last existing video track, which keeps the video lanes grouped above audio and elements. Every other kind of track is appended below all existing tracks.

The headless build spec in <Link href="/docs/cli#build-spec" className="text-primary hover:underline">the CLI docs</Link> is separate: it still places every video clip on one video track, even though the engine itself supports more.

            <C>Clip.speed</C> is a playback-rate multiplier for <strong className="text-on-surface font-medium">video clips only</strong>. Omitted means 1. The engine clamps it to 0.25 to 4. Change it with <C>engine.setClipSpeed</C>, not by writing the field alone, because the method also recomputes <C>durationFrames</C> so the clip&apos;s length on the timeline follows the new rate.

            <li>
              Speeding up always shrinks the clip in place. Slowing down grows it, clamped to the gap before the next clip on the same track. There is no ripple.

              It is a no-op on a locked track and on any clip that is not a video clip. Transitions that no longer make sense after the length change are pruned in the same undo entry.

            <li>
              The resolver maps a timeline frame to a source frame as <C>floor(localFrame * speed) + sourceStartFrame</C>, and the export worker honours the same speed, so preview and export agree.

            Cropping changes what is visible, not the clip&apos;s scale. The draw rect is sized from the cropped content, so a crop shrinks the box on stage while <C>transform.scale</C> stays as authored. The interactive crop mode in the preview is covered on the <Link href="/docs/editor#transforms" className="text-primary hover:underline">Editor page</Link>.
          </P>
          <P>
            If you build your own placement UI, <C>transformFromContainRect(contentWidth, contentHeight, stageWidth, stageHeight)</C> returns the explicit <C>Transform</C> that is visually identical to the renderer&apos;s default contain placement. Bake it in before the first gesture and grabbing a clip that never had a transform does not make it jump. <C>transformFromCoverRect</C> takes the same arguments and fills the stage instead of letterboxing.
