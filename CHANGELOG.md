# Changelog

All notable changes to the Elah packages (`@elah/core`, `@elah/react`,
`@elah/timeline`, `@elah/editor`, `@elah/cli`) are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the packages follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
`@elah/core`, `@elah/react`, `@elah/timeline`, and `@elah/editor` are released
together and share a version number. `@elah/cli` is a separate package and
versions independently, starting from its own 0.1.0.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0] — 2026-10-02

The premium editor port (PR #72), verified. Multiple video tracks, clip speed,
crop and corner radius, layered text animation with 14 templates, frame
sequences, stored project documents with media re-linking — and the eight
defects found while verifying it. `@elah/cli` 0.1.2 ships alongside (below).

### Added

- **`@elah/core`: reading a stored project.** `readProjectDocument(document)` turns
  stored JSON into a `Project` or throws `ProjectDocumentError`
  (`code: 'unreadable' | 'unsupported-version'`); it never returns half a project.
  `isReadableProjectDocument` is the boolean form. `PROJECT_VERSION` is the schema
  version this build writes. `relinkProjectMedia(project, assets)` points restored
  clips back at the media library by `src`, and reports clips whose `blob:`/`data:`
  source cannot be fetched again as `missing` (never dropped);
  `isRecoverableMediaSrc` and `missingMediaSummary` are its helpers.
  `engine.loadProject(project, { transport?, history? })` gained options, and the
  engine emits a `project:loaded` event (`ProjectLoadedEvent`) so the transport can
  rewind. `history: 'keep'` is for the re-link pass, which must not discard undo.
- **`@elah/core`: layered text and shape animation.** `TextAnimation` gained
  `inMotion` / `outMotion`, each a `MotionSpec` (opacity, `offsetX`/`offsetY`,
  `scale`, `rotation`, `ease`, `opacityEase`), so one end can drive several
  channels at once. New `TextAnimationEasing` curves include the overshooting
  `back-*`, `elastic-out` and `bounce-out`. The pure sampling helpers are public:
  `sampleTextAnimation`, `resolveRampFrames`, `motionForKind`,
  `TEXT_ANIMATION_KINDS`, `TEXT_ANIMATION_EASINGS`, `DEFAULT_TEXT_TRANSFORM`,
  `DEFAULT_SHAPE_TRANSFORM`.
- **`@elah/core`: text templates.** `BUILT_IN_TEXT_TEMPLATES` (14 looks),
  `findTextTemplate`, and `applyTextTemplate(template, clip)`, which returns the
  `Partial<Clip>` patch to hand to `engine.updateClip` so the change is undoable.
  Switching templates is clean rather than cumulative. `resolveTemplateRamp` and
  `MIN_/MAX_TEMPLATE_RAMP_FRAMES` clamp the ramp for hosts that build a timeline
  from a template.
- **`@elah/core`: two new vanilla stores.** `textStylePresetsStore`
  (+ `BUILT_IN_TEXT_STYLE_PRESETS`, `TextStylePreset`) holds reusable text looks.
  `clipLoadStore` reports which clips the preview cannot draw yet
  (`'loading' | 'error'`). It is renderer state, never part of the project,
  undo history or an autosave.
- **`@elah/core`: frame sequences.** An ordered set of images addressed by index
  (360 degree orbits, generated sets, storyboards): `createFrameSequence`,
  `frameAt`, `frameCount`, `normalizeFrameIndex`, `FrameSequenceController`
  (clock, drag-to-scrub, `wrap`/`pingpong` looping), `createFramePreloader`,
  `pickFrameSource`, `supportsImageType`, and `frameSequenceToProject`, which
  lays a sequence out as image clips so it can be edited and exported.
- **`@elah/core`: shared source-blob cache.** `sourceBlobCache`,
  `createSourceBlobCache`, `warmVideoSrc` de-duplicate video downloads between
  the demuxer and the preview.
- **`@elah/core`: media library.** `beginImportUrl` registers a remote URL as a
  `status: 'pending'` asset immediately and lets it resolve later.
  `determineAssetHasAudio`, `hasAudioDetermined` and `probeHasAudio` answer whether
  a video carries an audio track. `snapshotMediaLibrary`, `hydrateMediaLibrary`,
  `refreshMissingThumbnails` and `scheduleThumbnailById` carry the library across
  a page load. `MediaAsset` gained `MediaAssetAnalysis` / `MediaAssetTopObject`.
- **`@elah/core`: `PerfSummary`.** A once-a-second summary of the render loop's
  tick cost and overruns, silent unless the `PERF` trace channel is on
  (`__trace.on('PERF')`).
- **`@elah/core`: clip and track fields.** `Clip.speed` (0.25 to 4, video only;
  `duration` follows it and export honours it), `Clip.crop` (normalized source
  window) and `Clip.cornerRadius` (0 to 0.5). `Track.protected` (cannot be removed
  by the user) and `Track.pinned: 'bottom'` (`addTrack` keeps the lane below every
  non-pinned track). Both track fields are also accepted by `addTrack` options and
  `InitialTrackConfig`. `normalizeCrop`, `FULL_CROP`, `CropRect` and
  `transformFromContainRect` are exported for custom placement.
- **`@elah/core`: export.** `ExportOptions.outputHeight` is now the stage's *short*
  edge, so `1080` means 1920x1080 landscape and 1080x1920 portrait. The other
  edge is derived from the stage's aspect ratio and rounded to an even number.
- **`@elah/timeline`:** `TimelineRef.zoomAtAnchor(nextZoom)` zooms anchored on the
  playhead (or the viewport centre when it is off-screen).
  `growClipToAssetDuration(engine, clipId, expectedFallbackFrames, newDurationSec)`
  is the companion of core's `beginImportUrl`: insert a clip with a fallback length
  before its media has been probed, then grow it once the real duration is known.
  Clips that are still loading show a shimmer.
- **`@elah/react`:** `useClipLoadStore` and `useTextStylePresetsStore`.
- **`@elah/editor`:** the barrel now re-exports all of the above, including the
  vanilla `clipLoadStore` and `textStylePresetsStore` beside the other stores.
  Design tokens for the preview overlays and clip badge were added
  (`--elah-overlay-*`, `--elah-spinner-*`, `--elah-clip-badge-bg`,
  `--elah-toast-shadow`); see `docs/design-tokens.md`.

### Changed

- **Multiple video tracks are allowed.** The engine used to cap a project at one
  video track (`addTrack('video')` returned the existing one); it now adds another. Video tracks composite in
  track order (the topmost lane draws on top), and a new video track is placed
  directly below the last existing one.
- **Playback preferences are persisted by hand, not per frame.** Zoom, volume,
  mute, playback rate, loop and snap are still saved to `localStorage` under the
  same key and envelope, so nobody loses their settings. The write now happens
  when a preference changes; zustand's `persist` middleware re-serialised them on
  every frame of playback and every scrub move.
- **`serializeProject` / `deserializeProject` are unchanged for consumers.** They
  were briefly removed from `@elah/core` and the `@elah/editor` barrel during the
  port and have been restored as a facade over `readProjectDocument`, so no
  consumer break ships. One difference: a document with no `version` stamp is now
  read as version 1 instead of rejected, and a document from a newer build throws
  `ProjectDocumentError`. The `Not valid project JSON: ...` message for bad JSON
  is kept.
- **The timeline ruler and the rest of the UI share one timecode formatter.**
- **`@elah/timeline`: horizontal clip virtualisation.** Only clips inside the
  scrolled viewport (plus a margin, quantised to limit re-renders) are mounted.

### Fixed

- **Video frames could upload into a disposed GPU texture after a clip's source
  changed.** The layer read the texture before replacing the provider, so a
  re-pointed clip kept writing into the old one. A replaced provider also
  inherits the clip's reference count, so it is no longer exposed to idle
  eviction and prewarm seeks.
- **A preview loading spinner that could never clear** after a failed decoder
  re-open. The failure watcher is re-armed on the replacement provider, and
  disposing a provider always clears the clip's load state.
- **A borrowed frame stretched to the stage between clips.** The held-over frame
  is now fitted by its own dimensions, not the incoming clip's unknown ones.
- **The timeline ruler showed `00:90` instead of `01:30`.** Labels now roll over
  to minutes, show hours only when non-zero, and drop the frames segment on
  whole-second ticks. The ruler also uses the same content width as the lanes,
  so ticks no longer drift from clips at low zoom.
- **The clip loading shimmer had no CSS at all**, so a pending clip showed
  nothing. `.elah-clip-shimmer` and its sweep animation now ship in
  `@elah/timeline/styles`.
- **Horizontal clip virtualisation had been silently dropped** in the port;
  every clip on a long timeline was mounted.
- **Preview overlays and clip badges used hard-coded colours** and could not be
  themed; they now read the new `--elah-*` tokens.
- **Web playground: deleted imported media was resurrected from IndexedDB, and
  its object URLs were never revoked.** The library is now restored only for
  files a project still references, and every object URL the restore mints is
  revoked on cleanup.

### Documentation

- **Bundle sizes re-measured and the method fixed.** `BUNDLE_STRATEGY.md` now quotes
  what a browser downloads (esbuild, minified, gzipped, with code splitting) instead
  of the raw `tsc` output the old badges were based on: ~64 KiB at startup for the
  full SDK with the demuxer injected, ~11 KiB engine-only, and ~227 KiB on the quick-start
  path because `createDefaultDemuxerFactory` imports `mediabunny` statically. Reproduce
  with `node scripts/measure-bundle.mjs`.

- The package READMEs, `/docs/api`, and `docs/ai/ELAH_FOR_AI_AGENTS.md` now cover
  the API added above.

- **`playground/` is now `examples/`.** The three standalone apps that install
  `@elah/editor` from npm moved to [`examples/`](examples), and the `/examples`
  page on the site links to their new paths. The live in-browser playgrounds at
  `elah.dev/playground/*` are unrelated and unchanged.
- All three examples were verified against the published **0.4.1** packages from
  a clean registry install: `typecheck`, `dev`, and `build` for each, plus a full
  MP4 export in `examples/react` and `examples/next` under both the dev server
  and the production build.
- New [`examples/AGENTS.md`](examples/AGENTS.md) — the integration contract in one
  page, as an entry point for agents landing on the folder.
  [`docs/ai/ELAH_FOR_AI_AGENTS.md`](docs/ai/ELAH_FOR_AI_AGENTS.md) now links to
  the three runnable apps.
- New root `npm run verify:examples` — builds all three examples against the
  published packages. It is the only check in the repo that exercises the
  published tarballs rather than local source.
- The examples declare an inline favicon (no more `/favicon.ico` 404 in the
  console), and the Next example pins `turbopack.root` / `outputFileTracingRoot`
  so it stops inferring the monorepo root.
- `/docs/installation` corrected: the sample `package.json` pinned `^0.2.0`, the
  `transpilePackages` and Vite `optimizeDeps.exclude` lists omitted
  `@elah/react`, and the peer-dependency section did not mention `lucide-react`.

## `@elah/cli` [0.1.2] — 2026-10-02

### Changed

- Depends on `@elah/core@^0.6.0`. The build spec places every video clip on one
  video track, so overlapping video clips are a build error in the spec rather
  than something the engine rejects — the engine has allowed several video
  tracks since the multi-track change, but the spec has no way to say which
  one a clip belongs to.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- **`@elah/core`: the MP4 export worker now resolves in installed packages.**
  `exportVideo` spawned the worker via `new URL('./ExportWorker.ts', …)`, but the
  published package ships only the compiled `ExportWorker.js`. The `.ts` specifier
  was unresolvable, so any consumer bundler (Turbopack, webpack, Vite) failed on
  the `@elah/editor` barrel — on first page load, not just on export. The build now
  rewrites the extension in `dist/` as its final step. **Apps no longer need a
  `postinstall` patch script**; if you added one, delete it.
- **`@elah/editor` re-exports the full public API.** 40+ identifiers were missing
  from the barrel, including ones the docs told you to import from it:
  `snapFrame`, `buildSnapPoints`, `resolveOverlapEdgeSnap`, `clipsOverlap`,
  `DEFAULT_OVERLAP_TOLERANCE`, `useTransitionsStore`, `useAssets`, `importBlob`,
  `createShapeClip`, `createFreehandClip`, `serializeProject`,
  `deserializeProject`, `warmImageSrc`, `preloadProjectImages`, `cn`,
  `EditorContext`, the vanilla stores (`tracksStore`, `playbackStore`,
  `selectionStore`, `transitionsStore`, `mediaLibraryStore`), and the
  corresponding types (`ActiveShapeClip`, `ActiveFreehandClip`,
  `CreateClipOptions`, `TimelineClassNames`, `TimelineDropState`,
  `UseMediaLibraryApi`, `EditorContextValue`, `BoundStoreHook`, and the store
  `*State`/`*Actions` pairs). Renderer and debug internals stay `@elah/core`-only
  by design.

### Documentation

- New [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — the brief for coding agents working in this
  checkout — and [`docs/ai/ELAH_FOR_AI_AGENTS.md`](docs/ai/ELAH_FOR_AI_AGENTS.md),
  a single self-contained integration guide for AI tools that have no repo access.
- New `playground/minimal` example: the smallest complete custom editor UI.
- The `playground/next` and `playground/react` examples now import all three
  required stylesheets and declare the `lucide-react` peer dependency explicitly.
- Corrected the code samples on the `/examples` page, which did not compile
  against 0.4.x (`exportVideo` options, `ExportProgress` shape, the
  `DemuxerBackend` interface, and `ActiveTextClip` field access).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-28

### Added

- **New package `@elah/react`** — all React bindings in one place: the editor
  context (`EditorContext`, `useEditor`, `useTimelineEngine`,
  `usePlaybackEngine`), store hooks (`useTracksStore`, `usePlaybackStore`,
  `useSelectionStore`, `useTransitionsStore`, `useMediaLibraryStore`,
  `useMediaLibrary`/`useAssets`), and the audio hooks (`useAudioMixer`,
  `useMasterVolume`, `useTrackLevels`). Store hooks keep the imperative
  surface too (`useTracksStore.getState()` still works).
- `@elah/editor` now also re-exports the audio hooks.
- Test coverage for `@elah/react` (binding-layer tests for every hook,
  mirroring the `vitest`/`jsdom` conventions already used by
  `@elah/timeline` and `@elah/editor`).

### Changed

- **BREAKING (`@elah/core`)**: core is now truly framework-agnostic — zero
  React in its module graph (fixes [#42](https://github.com/elahlabs/elah/issues/42);
  importing `@elah/core` from Vue/Nuxt/Node no longer requires React).
  - All React hooks moved to `@elah/react` (re-exported unchanged by
    `@elah/editor`, so `@elah/editor` users are unaffected).
  - The Zustand mirrors are now vanilla stores exported as `tracksStore`,
    `playbackStore`, `selectionStore`, `transitionsStore`, and
    `mediaLibraryStore` (previously the React-bound `useXStore` exports).
    Imperative call sites migrate as
    `useTracksStore.getState()` → `tracksStore.getState()`.

## `@elah/cli` [0.1.1] — 2026-07-12

### Added

- **`elah serve` welcome page** — `GET /` now serves an HTML orientation page
  (route table, browser-connected status, copy-paste `/render` example)
  instead of a bare 404, for humans who open the listen address in a browser.
- **Copy-paste startup example** — `elah serve` now prints a ready-to-run
  render example on startup: `curl` on macOS/Linux, `Invoke-RestMethod` on
  Windows (PowerShell's `curl` alias doesn't accept `-H`/`-d`).

## [0.3.2] — 2026-07-12

Documentation only — reworked `@elah/core`, `@elah/timeline`, and
`@elah/editor` READMEs to cross-link `@elah/cli` and stay consistent with its
README pattern. No code changes.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-07-11

License changed from the Elah Community License (ECL) v1.0 to Apache-2.0,
across `@elah/core`, `@elah/timeline`, and `@elah/editor`. Copyright remains
with Elah Labs Private Limited. No code changes.

## `@elah/cli` [0.1.0] — 2026-07-11

Initial release of `@elah/cli` — a headless CLI and self-hosted render
server. Rendering runs core's real `exportVideo` pipeline in headless
branded Chrome, so output is bit-identical to the browser editor by
construction.

### Added

- **CLI commands** — `elah split`, `trim`, `export`, and `build` for headless
  project editing and MP4 export.
- **`elah serve`** — a long-lived HTTP render server (`POST /render`: spec
  JSON in, MP4 bytes out) with a warm browser and `--concurrency` control.
- **Seconds-based build spec** for programmatic and AI-generated projects,
  with path-addressed validation errors a generating model can self-correct
  from.
- **Library API** — `build`, `exportProject`, `createRenderSession`,
  `startServe`, `validateSpec`, `probeMedia` — importable directly from Node.
- Dockerfile (`packages/cli/Dockerfile`) with branded Chrome + fonts,
  entrypoint `elah serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080`.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-03

A feature release focused on **multi-track audio**, **shapes & freehand
drawing**, a **programmatic asset-insertion API**, and a fully **themeable
timeline**. Additive — no breaking changes to the 0.2.x public API.

### Added

#### `@elah/core`

- **Multi-track audio playback.** `AudioPlaybackController` now mixes multiple
  audio tracks against the `PlaybackEngine` clock with independent per-clip
  control, replacing the single-track v1 constraint.
- **Audio mixer hooks** — `useAudioMixer`, `useTrackLevels`, `useMasterVolume`
  for building level meters and volume UIs, plus a pluggable
  `defaultAudioResolver` / `AudioResolver` for custom audio fetch + decode.
- **Shape clips** — `createShapeClip`, `ShapeVariant`, and a GPU `ShapeLayer`.
  `Scene` now exposes `scene.shapes` (`ActiveShapeClip`).
- **Freehand clips** — `createFreehandClip` and a GPU `FreehandLayer`, surfaced
  on `Scene` as `scene.freehand` (`ActiveFreehandClip`).
- **Image decode cache warming** — `warmImageSrc`, `preloadProjectImages`, and
  the `ImageLoader` / `LoadedImage` types for eliminating first-paint stalls on
  image clips.
- **Expanded asset import** — `importUrl` and `importBlob` alongside
  `importFiles`; new `useAssets` hook, `mediaDragKindMime` helper, and
  `ImportUrlOptions` / `ImportBlobOptions` / `UseMediaLibraryApi` types.
- **`transformFromCoverRect`** placement helper (object-fit **cover**) added
  next to the existing `transformFromContainRect`.

#### `@elah/timeline`

- **Programmatic insertion API** — `insertMediaAsset` and `insertElement` place
  assets and elements on the timeline without a drag gesture, returning a typed
  `InsertAssetResult`. Powers tap-to-add on touch devices.
- **`classNames` slot API + `cn` util** — every timeline sub-component accepts a
  `TimelineClassNames` slot map so consumers can restyle without forking. A
  passed class always wins over defaults.
- **`--elah-*` CSS-variable theming** with a backward-compatible `timelineTheme`
  facade (deprecated in favor of the `classNames` prop / CSS variables). See
  [THEMING.md](./packages/timeline/THEMING.md).
- New public types — `TimelineDropState`, `ShapeVariant`.

#### `@elah/editor`

- **`SourcePanel`** — a new, fully slot-styled source/asset browser component
  (`SourcePanelProps`, `SourcePanelClassNames`) with an asset **activation** API
  (`AssetActivationPayload`, `AssetActivationHandler`) for tap-to-add flows.
- Re-exports all of the new `core` and `timeline` API above, including
  `insertMediaAsset` / `insertElement`, `importUrl`, audio mixer hooks, and
  `transformFromCoverRect`.

### Changed

- Timeline UI redesigned (clips, headers, ruler, playhead) to the Figma
  cyan / cool-navy theme; editor retinted to match.
- Timeline gestures migrated to **pointer events** (unifying mouse + touch) with
  pinch-to-zoom and touch tap-to-add.
- Video tracks capped at one and track-lock enforced on edits (single video
  track remains the v1 renderer constraint; audio is now multi-track).
- Export pipeline hardened: re-entrancy guard on `exportVideo`, improved audio
  mixing, and shape/freehand parity with the live renderer.

### Fixed

- Backward-seek frame-cache stability and video-decoder pivot handling.
- Generated clips can grow left without being clamped by source bounds.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-06-15

- Documented measured bundle sizes and improved package build scripts.

## [0.2.0]

- First public release of the three-package split: `@elah/core`,
  `@elah/timeline`, `@elah/editor`.
