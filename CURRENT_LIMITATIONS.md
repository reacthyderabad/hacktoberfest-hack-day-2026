## Playback & decode

- **Multiple video tracks are allowed, but not yet tuned for.** Since 0.6.0
  `addTrack('video')` adds another video track, and video tracks composite in
  track order (the topmost lane draws on top). The decode pipeline is still
  best-effort with no scheduler (below), so several video clips decoding at the
  same time can stall or hold a frame; one active video clip at a time is the
  tested path. **Audio is multi-track** as of 0.3.0 — `AudioPlaybackController`
  mixes several audio tracks with per-clip and master volume.
- **Reverse / backward scrubbing is unstable.** `StreamingFrameProducer` feeds a
  *forward* lookahead window. A backward jump larger than the lookahead is a
  discontinuity: it seeks the demuxer to the nearest keyframe and cold-starts the
  decoder, so scrubbing backward can show the last frame or a brief black frame
  until decode catches up.
- **No scheduler / predictive frame caching.** Decode is reactive to the current
  playhead. There is no component that warms frames ahead of where the playhead
  is *heading*, prioritizes across clips, or pre-rolls around cuts. This is the
  next planned architectural layer (see [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md)).
- **Cache misses on large jumps look like a stall.** On a miss the renderer keeps
  the last uploaded texture (by design — no flicker). During a big seek or a
  transition that means a held/last frame until the decoder produces the target.
- **One decoder per source URL.** Clips that share a `src` share a decoder. Two
  clips from the same file needing different frames simultaneously (e.g. a
  same-source transition) is not yet handled.
- **fps mismatch is worked around, not solved.** A video whose native fps differs
  from the project fps relies on a small cache-lookback fallback. See
  [`docs/known-bugs.md` KB-001](./docs/known-bugs.md).

## Editing UI

- **No rotation handle for video/image.** `MediaTransformOverlay` has 8 resize
  handles (non-uniform scale, **Shift** keeps aspect), a Resize/Crop toggle and
  drag-move. `transform.rotation` flows through both renderers and tilts the
  selection box, but the only way to set it on a video or image clip is through the
  engine. **Text** clips do have a rotate knob.
- **Media persistence is a seam, not a feature.** `snapshotMediaLibrary` /
  `hydrateMediaLibrary` and `readProjectDocument` / `relinkProjectMedia` (0.6.0) let a
  host save and restore the library's metadata and thumbnails and reopen a stored
  project, but core ships **no storage adapter** (the web playground's IndexedDB one
  lives in `apps/web`). Files imported from disk are `blob:` URLs that do not survive a
  reload and their bytes are not stored: `relinkProjectMedia` reports those clips as
  `missing` and the user must supply the file again.

## Compositing & effects

- **Transitions are `fade`, `slide` and `wipe`, with no direction control to speak
  of.** All three are wired end-to-end (preview via CSS snapshot overlay; export via a
  matching canvas pass). `slide` moves left when `direction` is `'left'` and right for
  any other value; `wipe` ignores `direction` entirely. `TransitionDirection` also types
  `'up'` and `'down'`, but neither is implemented. There are no other kinds (push, zoom,
  dissolve variants, custom).
- **Rotation does nothing on shapes.** The shape renderers do not apply
  `transform.rotation`, so a rotation channel in a `MotionSpec` and the `spin` entry/exit
  kind are text-only; on a shape clip they have no visible effect.
- **Text template `stagger` and `tracking` are inert.** `applyTextTemplate` ignores them
  and nothing in these packages executes them; they are metadata for a host that builds
  staggered or letter-spaced text itself.
- **No effects / filters / keyframe pipeline.** Layers apply `transform` and
  `opacity` only. Text and shape clips get entry/exit animation (`TextAnimation`,
  layered `MotionSpec`), but there is no per-clip shader-effect stack and no general
  keyframe channels.

## Export

- **Audio export is functional but not yet hardened.** The mix is rendered on the
  main thread via a single `OfflineAudioContext` (the Web Audio API isn't
  available in workers), each clip is whole-file decoded, and the PCM is
  transferred to the worker for encoding. It works for the common case; edge
  cases (very long timelines, many overlapping clips, exotic codecs) are not yet
  stress-tested.
- **Export is single-worker and sequential.** Frames render one at a time in one
  worker. There is no distributed/parallel export, though the deterministic
  `(project, frame) → pixels` contract is designed to allow it later.

## Platform & extensibility

- **No plugin architecture.** This is deliberate (`ARCHITECTURE.md` § 9, A5):
  the abstraction will be added when there is something concrete to plug in.
- **WebGL2 only.** The renderer targets `#version 300 es`. There is a WebGL1
  fallback path in `WebGLContext`, but no WebGPU backend yet (the `Renderer`
  interface is shaped to accept one).
- **`DecoderBackedVideoFrameProvider` is deprecated.** It remains in the tree for
  one release cycle; `StreamingFrameProducer` is the production path. Don't build
  on the deprecated class.
