/**
 * Authoritative "does this video carry an audio track?" determination.
 *
 * Why this exists — the two signals that came before it are both unreliable:
 *
 *  1. `probeVideo()` reads `HTMLVideoElement.audioTracks` / `mozHasAudio` /
 *     `webkitAudioDecodedByteCount`. Chromium exposes none of them usefully at
 *     `loadedmetadata` (`audioTracks` is behind a flag, and
 *     `webkitAudioDecodedByteCount` is still 0 because nothing has decoded
 *     yet), so it answers `false` for every video — including ones that
 *     obviously have sound.
 *  2. The waveform decode (`scheduleAudioAnalysis`) is authoritative when it
 *     succeeds, but it downloads and decodes the entire file, and it fails for
 *     reasons that have nothing to do with audio (CORS, unsupported codec).
 *
 * Reading the container instead is both correct and cheap: mediabunny fetches
 * only the header/index via range requests, never the media payload.
 *
 * The determination is memoised per asset and started at import time so that
 * callers which import and insert in the same click — the gallery's "add to
 * editor", which registers a placeholder asset via `beginImportUrl` and inserts
 * it immediately — get a real answer rather than the placeholder seed value.
