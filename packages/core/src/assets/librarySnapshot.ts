/**
 * Carrying the media library across a page load.
 *
 * The library is module-scoped and rebuilt empty on every load, which is fine
 * for the assets themselves — a clip plays from its own `src` and never asks
 * the library for anything. What does not survive is everything the library
 * alone holds: the filmstrip decoded from the video, the waveform decoded from
 * its audio, the real duration and dimensions. So a restored composition comes
 * back with grey placeholder boxes where every clip's thumbnails were, and the
 * only way to get them back is to decode all of it again — if the source can
 * even be fetched, which for a file the user dragged in from their own device
 * it cannot.
 *
 * This module is the two halves of fixing that, and nothing else: turn the
 * library into something storable, and put a stored one back. Where it is
 * stored is deliberately not decided here — `packages/core` has no business
 * knowing about IndexedDB, tenants or projects, and the app that does owns the
 * adapter (`apps/web/lib/media-library-snapshot.ts`).
 *
 * The ids are kept. A restored clip's `assetId` names the asset it had when it
 * was saved, so hydrating under the same ids makes those references resolve
 * directly; `relinkProjectMedia` stays the fallback for anything that comes
 * back by `src` instead (a re-import, or a snapshot that predates the clip).
