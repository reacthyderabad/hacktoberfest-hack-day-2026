/**
 * textAnimation — pure resolution of a clip's entry/exit animation into the two
 * channels every renderer already understands: `opacity` and `Transform`.
 *
 * No React, no DOM, no renderer imports. Deterministic: the same arguments always
 * produce the same sample, which is what lets playback and export agree frame for
 * frame.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Two ways to describe an animation, one way to sample it
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * An end can be described either as a single `TextAnimationKind` enum (`in` /
 * `out`) or as a layered `MotionSpec` (`inMotion` / `outMotion`) that drives
 * opacity, offset, scale and rotation at once with its own easing curve.
 *
 * These are NOT two code paths. `motionForKind` resolves an enum into a
 * `MotionSpec`, and everything below samples specs — so the enum is sugar and
 * cannot drift from the model. The enum remains what the properties panel's
 * Entry/Exit selects write and what every already-saved project contains;
 * `legacyAnimationParity.test.ts` pins it to ~30k recorded samples so that
 * sugar stays bit-for-bit identical to what shipped before the layered model.
 *
 * A layered spec on an end WINS over an enum on the same end.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Direction semantics (read this before wiring it into the resolver)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `in` and `out` are NOT mirror images of each other, and the asymmetry is the
 * whole point:
 *
 *   in  — the clip *travels toward* its authored resting position. It starts one
 *         full travel vector away from rest and arrives EXACTLY at rest on the
 *         frame the ramp completes (localFrame === durationFrames).
 *   out — the clip *departs from* rest. It sits at rest until the out ramp
 *         opens, then moves one full travel vector away from it.
 *
 * A kind names the DIRECTION OF TRAVEL, identically for both ends. `slide-up`
 * means "motion in the upward direction" in both cases, so:
 *
 *   in:  'slide-up'  → starts BELOW rest, moves up into rest.
 *   out: 'slide-up'  → starts at rest, moves up and away.
 *
 * Which means a clip with `{ in: 'slide-up', out: 'slide-up' }` drifts upward
 * for its whole life, never reversing. That is intentional. If you want it to
 * leave the way it came, pair `in: 'slide-up'` with `out: 'slide-down'`.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Coordinate space
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `Transform.x` / `.y` are normalized 0..1 of the stage, origin top-left, and
 * they address the clip's CENTRE for both of the clip types that can carry an
 * animation:
 *   - text  — `computeTextLayout` reads `transform.x/y` as the block centre
 *             (textLayout.ts:169-173).
 *   - shape — `paintShape` reads them as the shape centre (ShapeLayer.ts:58-59).
 * y therefore grows DOWNWARD, so "up" is a negative y delta.
 *
 * Slide distance is expressed in those same normalized units, which means the
 * same constant covers a different number of pixels per axis on a non-square
 * stage (on 1080x1920: 0.15 is 288px vertically but only 162px horizontally).
 * That is accepted — the alternative, correcting for aspect, would make a
 * "slide up" and a "slide left" cover visibly different fractions of the frame.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The transform-or-nothing rule (a jump bug lives here)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `Clip.transform === undefined` does not mean "identity" — it means "the
 * renderer applies its own default", and the defaults DIFFER PER CLIP TYPE:
 *
 *   text  — centre (0.5, 0.5), scale 1     (textLayout.ts:152, :169-173)
 *   shape — centre (0.5, 0.5), scale 0.5   (ShapeLayer.ts:58-61, mirrored in
 *                                           ExportWorker.ts:644-649)
 *
 * So the moment we synthesize a transform for a clip that had none, we must
 * reproduce that clip type's default exactly or the clip jumps (a shape would
 * double in size). Hence `defaultTransform` is a REQUIRED argument and the two
 * correct values are exported below — pass `DEFAULT_TEXT_TRANSFORM` for text
 * clips and `DEFAULT_SHAPE_TRANSFORM` for shape clips.
 *
 * For the same reason, a pure-opacity animation (`fade`, or no kinds at all)
 * returns NO transform: leaving the field undefined keeps the renderer default
 * in play, which is strictly safer than re-deriving it.
