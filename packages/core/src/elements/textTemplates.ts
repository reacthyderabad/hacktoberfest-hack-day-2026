/**
 * textTemplates — named, reusable text looks that bundle a STYLE and a MOTION
 * into one thing an author can apply in a single click.
 *
 * Pure data plus one pure function. No React, no stores, no renderer imports:
 * `applyTextTemplate` takes a template and the clip it is being dropped on and
 * returns a `Partial<Clip>` patch. Everything downstream — GPU preview, the
 * 2D export worker, undo/redo, project save — already knows how to handle
 * ordinary clip fields, so a template inherits playback/export parity for free
 * rather than needing a second rendering path. That is the whole design.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this is not just another TextStylePreset
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `TextStylePreset` (stores/textStylePresets.store.ts) is six style fields and
 * nothing else — it deliberately cannot express motion, placement, or a
 * background chip, and it is user-saveable. A template is the production-ready
 * unit: the look AND the entry/exit animation AND the box treatment, shipped by
 * us and tuned so the result is usable without further editing. The two
 * coexist; presets stay the quick "restyle these glyphs" affordance.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Ramps are FRACTIONS here, frames on the clip
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `TextAnimation.durationFrames` is absolute, which is correct for a stored
 * clip but wrong for a template: a fixed 15-frame ramp applied to a 9-frame
 * clip produces an entry that never completes, so the text never reaches its
 * resting position or full opacity before the clip ends — visible as text that
 * flickers in half-faded and vanishes. Templates therefore describe their ramp
 * as a fraction of clip length, and `resolveTemplateRamp` turns that into a
 * legal frame count for the specific clip it lands on. See that function for
 * the two clamps and why each exists.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Templates never touch `content`
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Applying a template to a clip the author has already typed into must not
 * discard their words, so `content` is not in the patch. A template restyles;
 * it does not rewrite.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `stagger` and `tracking` are not this module's business to execute
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Two fields here describe something a single clip cannot express: breaking one
 * line of copy into several clips that enter one after another (`stagger`), and
 * faking letterspacing by respacing the characters (`tracking`). Both are read
 * by the host app that builds a timeline from a template — nothing in this repo
 * does; a host that wants either must implement it. Both are IGNORED by
 * `applyTextTemplate`, which patches
 * exactly one clip and stays a pure restyle.
 *
 * That split is deliberate. Executing a stagger means knowing the stage height,
 * the clip's start frame and how many pieces there are; none of that belongs in
 * a function whose contract is "here is a patch for this clip". Describing it
 * still belongs here, because it is part of what makes a look that look — a
 * Brand Drop with its words arriving together is not a Brand Drop.

 * template actually governs. Callers hand the result straight to
 * `engine.updateClip`, which is what puts the change on the undo stack and in
 * the saved document like any other edit.
 *
 * Two behaviours worth knowing:
 *
 * **Switching templates is clean, not cumulative.** Every optional box field is
 * present in the patch, set to `undefined` when the template does not use it.
 * Without that, applying Quote (a panel) and then Title Card (no panel) would
 * leave the panel behind, and the second template would not look like itself.
 * The author's own edits to those fields are lost by the same rule — which is
 * the expected meaning of "apply this template".
 *
 * **Placement merges rather than replaces.** A template that sets `placement`
 * overrides only x/y, keeping the clip's scale, rotation and anchor. Synthesizing
 * the rest from `DEFAULT_TEXT_TRANSFORM` is safe here because that constant is
 * exactly what the text renderer already applies to a clip with no transform, so
 * a clip that never had one does not jump. (That is only true for TEXT clips —
 * shapes default to `scale: 0.5`. See resolver/textAnimation.ts.)
