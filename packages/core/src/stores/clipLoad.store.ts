 * renderer state, not composition state, and it must never reach undo history
 * or an autosave. The renderer writes it at clip-boundary events only —
 * acquire, first successful upload, open failure, release — so subscribers see
 * a handful of notifications per clip and nothing at all per frame.
 *
 * Every write is compared first: a repeated `'loading'` report (acquire runs on
 * every tick a clip is in the scene) returns the same state object and notifies
 * nobody.
